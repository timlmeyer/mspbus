2. Fair Dealing Rights
----------------------

Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,

perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li id="3a">to Reproduce and Distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or
Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:</li>
<li id="3b">to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to
the original Work.</li>
</ol>

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not
limited to the rights described in Section 4(g).

4. Restrictions
---------------
The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="4a">You may Distribute the Work only under the terms of this License.
You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for,
this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute. You may not
offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this
License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may
not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the
Work You Distribute. When You Distribute the Work, You may not impose
any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the
ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights
granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. If You create
an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
Section 4(e), as requested.</li>
<li id="4b">You may Distribute an Adaptation only under the terms of this
License. You must include a copy of, or the URI for, this License with every
copy of each Adaptation You Distribute. You may not offer or impose any
terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of this
License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of this
License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work
as included in the Adaptation You Distribute. When You Distribute the
Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on
the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
under the terms of the this License.</li>
<li id="4c">An executable Object form of the Work may be deployed
in a website, for the purpose of communicating information to other
human beings, in any manner, for any number of users and page views.
You may not, however, display advertisements for which you receive
any monetary compensation or other consideration, and you may not charge
users to access the executable Object form of the Work or the website
on which you deploy the executable Object form of the Work.</li>
<li id="4d">You may not exercise any of
the rights granted to You in Section 3 above or in 4(c) in any manner that is
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation.</li>
<li id="4e">If You Distribute the Work or any Adaptations, You must, unless a
request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all
copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or
means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of
the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the
URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the
case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the
Adaptation (e.g., "Based on code adapted from original Work by Original
Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in
any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
Adaptation, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all
contributing authors of the Adaptation appears, then as part of these
credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the
other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use
the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in
the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use
of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of
the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.</li>
<li id="4f">This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as
required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of
the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</li>
<li id="4g">For the avoidance of doubt:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li id="4gi"><strong>Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes.</strong>
In those jurisdictions in which
the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License;</li>
<li id="4gii"><strong>Waivable Compulsory License Schemes.</strong>
In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or
use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section
4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any
statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,</li>
<li id="4giii"><strong>Voluntary License Schemes.</strong>
The Licensor reserves the right to collect
royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is
otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section
4(c).</li></ol></li>
<li id="4h"><strong>Submission of Contributions.</strong>
Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to
the Licensor that is accepted to become part of the work shall be
distributed subject to the conditions of this License, without any
additional terms or conditions, or according to any other license
(commercial or otherwise) that the Licensor is permitted to choose.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the
terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor
regarding such Contributions.</li>
</ol>

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
---------------------------------------------

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK
AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability
--------------------------

EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination
--------------

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="7a">This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations from You under
this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided
such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those
licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of
this License.</li>
<li id="7b">Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
stated above.</li>
</ol>

8. Miscellaneous
----------------

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="8a">Each time You Distribute the Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient
a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
granted to You under this License.</li>
<li id="8b">Each time You Distribute an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient
a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.</li>
<li id="8c">If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
enforceable.</li>
<li id="8d">No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.</li>
<li id="8e">This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified
without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.</li>
<li id="8f">The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and
the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These
rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in
which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the
corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty
provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of
rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights
not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be
included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the
license of any rights under applicable law.</li></ol>
